# Classic Pong Arcade Game

The Classic Pong Arcade Game is a Python implementation of the iconic Pong game using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This game showcases the use of three main classes: `Ball`, `Paddle`, and `Scoreboard`, all of which inherit from the `Turtle` class provided by the Turtle graphics library.

Pong was one of the first arcade video games created, and it simulates a tennis-like game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, trying to hit the ball back and forth without letting it pass their paddle.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend and see who can score the most points!
- Realistic ball movement: The ball bounces off paddles and the top and bottom walls with realistic physics.
- Score tracking: The scoreboard keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen.
- Responsive controls: Control the paddles using keyboard inputs for a classic arcade experience.
